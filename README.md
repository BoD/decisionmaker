# Decision maker

A tiny web app to help make decisions.

- Enter a set of criteria, with their importance.
- Then enter your possible choices, with a score for each criteria.
- The app will tell which choice is the best based on the scores and importances.

It is a single Javascript powered web page (source is in Kotlin).

A version of this is hosted on my
